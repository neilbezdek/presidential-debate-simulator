# presidential-debate-time-machine

Have you ever wondered what a presidential debate between JFK and Donald Trump would look like? Or how Bill and Hillary Clinton might bicker on stage?

Welcome to the Presidential Debate Time Machine, where I use machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to explore how presidential campaign discourse has evolved over time and to imagine what a simulated debate among past and contemporary candidates would look like.

This project is currently underway but will be complete by Nov 17, 2016. Stay tuned for updates!
